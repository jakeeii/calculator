# calculator

A simple calculator that I created as a capstone project to display my introductory HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. The calculator is designed to do the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and can also compute numbers with decimals. It has both clear and delete button, the former which completely erases the entire display and the latter which only removes the last inputted number or operator. The calculator can also take in multiple pairs of numbers at a time (Ex: 4 + 6 - 3 x 20 รท 4) but will not compute according to PEMDAS, i.e. it will first compute the beginning pair of numbers (4 + 6 = 10), get the result of that and then compute that result with the next number (10 - 3) until there is only the solution left (10 - 3 = 7, 7 x 20 = 140, 140 รท 4 = 35). This is by design but it is something to be noted so that users do not expect a different result. The screen can display up to 15 characters and will give an error if more numbers are inputted after this. The calculator also will not let users divide by zero and will alert the user if this is attempted.
